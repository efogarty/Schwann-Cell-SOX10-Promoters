# Schwann-Cell-SOX10-Promoters

These scripts are designed for use with BioPerl, to search fasta-formatted sequences for SOX10 binding motifs. The identification of motifs is inclusive, with one-base variations from a high confidence binding motif. The output file includes the fasta header, the motif sequence identified, and the position of the motif in the sequence.
